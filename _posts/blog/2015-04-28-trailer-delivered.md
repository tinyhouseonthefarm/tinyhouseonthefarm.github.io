Wow! It's actually happening! 

Tom, the delivery guy from Tumbleweed, called me in the afternoon yesterday to say that he'd be coming at 6pm all the way from Colorado. When he arrived, he had a number of trailers, and in order to take mine off, he had to jack it up so that it was no longer resting on the other trailers and drive out from underneath it.  (Cheers to the other builders in Cambria and Phoenix that are getting the other trailers - we should start some kind of support group!)

Tom lowered my trailer to the ground, put the tires back on, and disconnected everything. We went through a checklist to make sure everything was in working order, then I signed the paperwork and we moved the trailer to its building location.

It's one thing to think about 18' in the abstract, but to see it in person, well, it's TINY. That this square here is going to be my porch, and this corner here is my window seat, and this is going to be the kitchen, just doesn't seem possible right now.
