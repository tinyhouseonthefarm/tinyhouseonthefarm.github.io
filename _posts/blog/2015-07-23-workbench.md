I have a huge delivery of lumber for the lofts and roof coming on Monday, so in the meantime, I bought a miter saw in order to cut the rafters, and, in the fashion of "If you give a mouse a cookie...", I had to make a workbench to go along with it. 

I (mostly) followed [this tutorial](http://www.familyhandyman.com/workshop/workbench/how-to-build-a-workbench-super-simple-50-bench/view-all).

It was pretty easy, especially with a nailgun. The toughest things were the hundreds of mosquitos that seemed to converge last night, and trying to get the legs on it, working on uneven ground. But I think it worked out nicely!
