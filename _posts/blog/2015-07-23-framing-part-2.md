The walls are finally up! 

I built the walls on the trailer bed so I'd have a flat surface. Here's the two long side walls.

My family and I thought we might be able to put the walls up ourselves, so we gave it a shot. Cue a large CRACK!!! sound, and we gave up on that notion.

So I got some professional help too.

My little brother helped me get the front wall up on a Saturday afternoon. Thanks, Bro!

The front wall is made with engineered lumber so that it's extra strong, because of the huge window it has, plus the windows on either side of it, making a little alcove beside the porch. 

Here's the alcove in the floorplan:

There were a couple of things that really helped with putting the walls up. First was [this device](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Crescent-19-in-Forged-Alloy-Nail-Puller-56/203984930), which was a huge help for getting wrongly placed nails out.

Second was videos like [this one](http://www.finehomebuilding.com/item/13922/framing-tips-how-to-straighten-a-wall), which taught me how to bring in or push out a wall.

I put plywood on the front wall, and now I'm waiting for some lumber to be delivered before I start on the lofts, and then the roof, hopefully before the rains from El Nino hit!
